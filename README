This is a somewhat of a playground project. 
Inspired by a couple of projects I am trying to analyze a certain problem and a work flow and solve few of my problems. This is a rough draft and a work in progress. 
Feedbac welcome. 

So far it is pretty much static page that you can interact with using keyboard. 

you can move up and down in the task list with up and down arrow
you can hit enter to log time on the current item's entry
you can hit space to mark it as completed
tilde will popout new task dialog
back slash will pop out the time entry widget
